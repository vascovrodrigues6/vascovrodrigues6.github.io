Always had my interest for Mathematics and Technologies, knowing since the early days, the journey i wanted to take in my Education.

Had my first contact with with programming in the last year of high school and since then i lined my objectives into learning more from it. Joined ISEP and finished my Bachelors in Computer Software Engineering (2017-2020) with an average of 15,13.

Decided to continue my journey in Information and Knowledge Systems Masters instead of Artificial Intelligence since it explores a wide range of fields like ETL Engineering, multiple applications of Artificial Intelligence, Decision Support Systems and ERPs. 

Some of the projects done in Masters degree can be seen in the Other Noteworthy Projects in the Projects section.

Here is a list of skills i have!
