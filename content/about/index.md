Always had my interest for Mathematics and Technologies, knowing since the early days, the journey I wanted to take in my Education.

Had my first contact with programming in the last year of high school and since then I lined my objectives into learning more from it. Joined ISEP and finished my Bachelors in Computer Software Engineering (2017-2020) with an average of 15,13.

Decided to continue my journey in Information and Knowledge Systems Masters at ISEP (2020-2022) instead of Artificial Intelligence since it explores a wide range of fields like ETL Engineering, multiple applications of Artificial Intelligence, Decision Support Systems and ERPs. Finished my Masters with an average grade of 16,81 with 18 on my [dissertation](dissertation.pdf)

Some of the projects done in Masters degree can be seen in the Other Noteworthy Projects in the Projects section.

Here is a list of skills I have!
