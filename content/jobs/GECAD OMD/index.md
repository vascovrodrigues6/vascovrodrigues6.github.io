- Integrated an international project with multiple interdisciplinary teams. The Portuguese consortium worked on an e‑commerce use case for a footwear company.
- Revamped and enhanced an user‑centric chatbot that accurately identified user’s intentions, extracted business domain entities and offer customized product recommendations based on user preferences and gathered information.
- Conducted a thorough examination of the chatbot models and detected instances of over‑fitting. Subsequently, implemented a successful restructuring to remove the over‑fitting and optimize the performance of the models, resulting in F1‑scores of 0.90 and 0.88, in Intent Classification and Named‑Entity Recognition tasks.
- Implemented containerization and deployment of the chatbot application using Docker and Kubernetes, resulting in increased user retention and satisfaction by reducing search time by 30% and ensuring seamless user experience.
